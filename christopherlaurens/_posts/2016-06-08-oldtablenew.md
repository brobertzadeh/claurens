title: Old Table New
---

I made this table in 2006. Had to do substantial renovation on it maybe 3 or 4 years later because it had moved so much with the change of seasons. 

Now I have really given it the works: new kauri strips between the Avondale Racecourse jarrah and new butterfly dovetails to hold them together.

The whole surface handplaned then sanded down to a final 800g grit hard oil burnishing. An application of natural beeswax to add a nice tactile finish.

*The slow movement of the wood as it adjusts to different moisture content in the air is amazing. As someone once said: "The mill wheels of time grist ever slow but ever sure."*

![Replacing the strips]({{ site.url }}/img/replace.jpg)
*I took all of the strips out, re-routed and chisled the grooves, drilled some of the butterfly dovetails out and replaced them.*

*Then, it starts to look like something real again. Until it is ready to serve meals at a different house, where it will be much loved and protected.*

*Thought I would put myself in the picture. This table has served so many wonderful meals over the years that it is fitting it now goes to my son Glenn for his birthday.*
